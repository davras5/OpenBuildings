## Overview

This tool estimates building volumes by combining:
- **Building footprints** from a PostGIS/Supabase database (WGS84 geography)
- **Terrain elevation** from swissALTI3D (0.5m resolution)
- **Surface elevation** from swissSURFACE3D (0.5m resolution, includes buildings)

The calculation is based on a voxel approach: creating a 1×1 meter grid within each building footprint and sampling elevations at each point.

**Key Features:**
- Orientation-aligned grid generation for better accuracy
- Direct PostGIS/Supabase database integration
- Automatic WGS84 → LV95 coordinate transformation
- Dynamic tile indexing (year-agnostic)
- Flexible output (CSV export and/or database update)

## How It Works

### The Method

The volume estimation follows these steps:

1. **Load Building Footprint** from PostGIS database (WGS84 coordinates)
2. **Transform to LV95** (Swiss projection system used by elevation models)
3. **Create Aligned Grid:**
   - Calculate building orientation using minimum area bounding rectangle
   - Rotate building to align with axes
   - Generate 1×1m grid points in rotated space
   - Rotate grid points back to original LV95 coordinates
   - This improves coverage for diagonal/non-axis-aligned buildings
4. **Sample Elevations:**
   - Identify required GeoTIFF tiles based on building location
   - Sample terrain elevation (swissALTI3D) at each grid point
   - Sample surface elevation (swissSURFACE3D) at each grid point
5. **Calculate Volume:**
   - Base height = minimum terrain elevation across all grid points
   - Building height at each point = surface elevation - base height
   - Volume = Σ(building heights) × 1m²

### Why Orientation-Aligned Grids?

For a rectangular building rotated 45°:
- **Standard axis-aligned grid**: Many grid points fall outside the footprint → lower accuracy
- **Orientation-aligned grid**: Grid aligns with building edges → better coverage

This significantly improves volume estimation accuracy, especially for non-axis-aligned buildings.

## Requirements

### Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary geopandas rasterio numpy pandas shapely pyproj
```

Or use the requirements file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Requirements

**1. Building Footprints Database**
- PostGIS or Supabase database
- Table: `public.buildings` (configurable)
- Geometry column: `geography` type in WGS84 (EPSG:4326)
- Must contain polygon geometries

**2. swissALTI3D Tiles**
- Digital Terrain Model (DTM) - bare earth elevation
- Resolution: 0.5m
- Format: GeoTIFF
- Coordinate system: Swiss LV95 (EPSG:2056)
- Naming: `swissalti3d_YYYY_XXXX-YYYY_0.5_2056_5728.tif`
- Download: [swisstopo swissALTI3D](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/hoehenmodell-swissalti3d)

**3. swissSURFACE3D Tiles**
- Digital Surface Model (DSM) - includes buildings, vegetation, etc.
- Resolution: 0.5m
- Format: GeoTIFF
- Coordinate system: Swiss LV95 (EPSG:2056)
- Naming: `swisssurface3d-raster_YYYY_XXXX-YYYY_0.5_2056_5728.tif`
- Download: [swisstopo swissSURFACE3D](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/hoehenmodell-swisssurface3d-raster)

### Understanding Tile Naming

Tile IDs are based on the southwest corner coordinates in LV95, divided by 1000:
- Example: `2609-1176` covers coordinates 2609000-2610000 (East) and 1176000-1177000 (North)
- A building at LV95 coordinates (2609500, 1176300) would use tile `2609-1176`

## Installation

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davras5/OpenBuildings.git
cd OpenBuildings/tools/volume-estimator
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Organize Elevation Data

Store GeoTIFF tiles in separate directories:

```
D:\SwissAlti3D\
├── swissalti3d_2025_2600-1224_0.5_2056_5728.tif
├── swissalti3d_2025_2601-1224_0.5_2056_5728.tif
└── ...

D:\swissSURFACE3D\
├── swisssurface3d-raster_2023_2600-1224_0.5_2056_5728.tif
├── swisssurface3d-raster_2023_2601-1224_0.5_2056_5728.tif
└── ...
```

**Note:** The script automatically handles different years (2019-2025+) by scanning filenames.

### 4. Prepare Database

Ensure your Supabase/PostGIS database has:
- A table with building footprints (default: `public.buildings`)
- A geometry/geography column in WGS84 (default column name: `geog`)

## Technical Details

### Coordinate Systems

- **Input:** WGS84 (EPSG:4326) - worldwide standard, used by GPS
- **Processing:** Swiss LV95 (EPSG:2056) - Swiss national coordinate system
- **Height Models:** LV95 coordinates, elevations in meters above sea level

The script automatically transforms coordinates between systems.

### Volume Calculation Method

**Base Height Determination:**
```
base_height = min(terrain_elevation_at_all_grid_points)
```
Using the minimum ensures we measure from the lowest point of terrain under the building.

**Building Height Calculation:**
```
For each grid point:
  building_height = max(0, surface_elevation - base_height)
```
Negative values (underground) are set to 0.

**Volume Calculation:**
```
volume = Σ(building_heights) × 1m²
```

### Grid Generation Algorithm

1. Calculate building orientation using minimum area bounding rectangle
2. Get longest edge angle → rotation angle
3. Rotate polygon by -angle (align to axes)
4. Generate axis-aligned 1×1m grid
5. Filter points inside rotated polygon
6. Rotate grid points back by +angle
7. Result: grid aligned to building orientation in LV95 space

### Tile Indexing

The script scans directories on startup and builds an index:
```
Tile ID → File Path
"2609-1176" → "D:\SwissAlti3D\swissalti3d_2025_2609-1176_0.5_2056_5728.tif"
```

This approach:
- Handles any year automatically (2019-2025+)
- Fast O(1) lookup during processing
- Works with mixed years (e.g., 2023 Surface + 2025 ALTI)

### Tile Selection

For each building:
1. Get bounding box in LV95 coordinates
2. Calculate required tiles: `tile_x = floor(x/1000)`, `tile_y = floor(y/1000)`
3. Buildings spanning multiple tiles: all tiles are loaded and sampled

## Performance & Limitations

### Performance

- **Processing speed:** ~10-20 buildings/second (varies with building size and complexity)
- **Memory usage:** Low - processes buildings individually
- **Tile caching:** Tiles loaded on demand and cached in memory during execution
- **Database:** Fetches buildings efficiently with spatial filters

### Limitations

**What Works:**
- Buildings spanning multiple tiles
- Complex building shapes
- Mixed tile years
- Large-scale processing
- **Official survey data advantage:** Uses official cadastral survey building footprints, which prevents footprint merging issues common with computer vision or point cloud clustering methods

**Known Issues:**
- Missing elevation data → `status: no_height_data`
- Very small buildings (<1m²) → `status: no_grid_points`
- Underground portions are set to 0 (cannot estimate below-ground volume from DSM)
- Accuracy limited by 0.5m resolution of elevation models
- Grid alignment uses minimum bounding rectangle (may not be optimal for very irregular shapes)
- **swissSURFACE3D class merging:** The raster model merges multiple classes (Ground/Class 2, Vegetation/Class 3, Buildings/Class 6, Bridges/Class 17, Water/Class 9). Small buildings covered by tall trees may show inaccurate heights, though this is uncommon as most roofs are not vegetation-covered

**Requirements:**
- Both swissALTI3D and swissSURFACE3D tiles must be available locally
- Buildings must have valid geometry in database
- Building must be within coverage area of available tiles

### Accuracy Considerations

**Factors affecting accuracy:**
1. **Elevation model resolution:** 0.5m grid → ±0.5m positional accuracy
2. **Grid alignment:** Better for rectangular buildings
3. **Terrain complexity:** More accurate on flat terrain
4. **Building size:** Larger buildings → more grid points → better accuracy
5. **Data currency:** Using matching years for ALTI and SURFACE is ideal

**Expected accuracy:** Typically within 5-10% for well-defined buildings with good elevation coverage.
