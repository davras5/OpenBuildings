**Swiss building data. Open in theory. Now open in practice.**

---

## What It Is

A shared foundation for Swiss building data—curated, connected, and maintained.

We've done the work most organizations struggle to even scope: identified what matters, integrated the best open sources, and built something coherent enough to actually use.

Ready to plug into your planning, reporting, and decision-making.

## The Problem

Everyone wants data-driven decisions. Few understand what that requires.

Small organizations can't afford specialists. Large ones have them, but keep results locked away—unpublished, unmaintained, eventually forgotten.

Same outcome: no shared foundation. The same work, done a hundred times in isolation.

The workflow is identical whether you're managing 300 buildings or 3 million. But everyone stops at their own portfolio.

We didn't.

## Why It Matters

Buildings account for 40% of Switzerland's CO₂ emissions. Every path to net zero runs through the building stock.

You can't decarbonize what you can't measure. And right now, most organizations are either guessing or paying someone to figure out what should already exist.

A shared foundation changes that. Plan with real numbers. Report with confidence. Compare across portfolios, communes, cantons.

One investment. Everyone benefits.

## How It Works

We select the best open sources—GWR, cadastral survey, elevation models, zoning data. We connect them into a coherent whole. We maintain it over time.

You get a foundation, not a data project.

## Who It's For

- Portfolio managers who need building data without building a data team
- Municipalities planning decarbonization strategies
- Researchers who want to analyze, not wrangle
- Anyone who shouldn't have to start from scratch

## Roadmap

Start where we are: Switzerland. The foundation is there. Now we add insight.

Topics follow demand—carbon intensity, market data, location analytics. We stay focused until we know what's actually useful.

The problem isn't uniquely Swiss. We'll expand when the foundation is solid.

---

## Business Model

**Free:** Explore, search, download individual buildings. The foundation stays open.

**Paid:** Bulk data, API access, portfolio reports. For organizations that need more and can afford to contribute.

Revenue keeps the foundation maintained. The core remains open.

---

## Principles

**Open by default.** If we figured it out, you don't have to. Methods, sources, limitations—all public.

**Quality over quantity.** Good data beats more data. Focus beats sprawl.

**Interoperable.** Buildings last centuries. Technology changes every few years. We follow established standards so the architecture outlives the tools.

*Building data belongs to everyone. We're making that real.*
