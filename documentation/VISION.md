**Swiss building data. Open in theory. Now open in practice.**

## What It Is

A building data foundation you can see, use, and learn from.

We've done the work most organizations struggle to even scope: defined what data matters, found the best open sources, connected them into a coherent whole.

Curated. Connected. Maintained. Ready to plug into your planning, reporting, and decision-making.

---

## The Problem

Everyone wants data-driven decisions. Few know what that requires.

Small organizations can't afford specialists to do the work. Large ones do it but keep it locked away – unpublished, unmaintained, forgotten.

Same outcome: no shared foundation. The same work, done a hundred times in isolation.

The workflow is the same whether it's 3,000 buildings or 3 million. But everyone stops at their own portfolio.

We didn't.

## Why It Matters

Buildings account for 40% of Switzerland's CO₂ emissions. Every path to net zero runs through the building stock.

But you can't decarbonize what you can't measure. And right now, most organizations are guessing – or paying someone to figure out what should already exist.

A shared foundation changes that. Plan with real numbers. Report with confidence. Compare across portfolios, communes, cantons.

One investment. Everyone benefits.

---

## How It Works

We select the best open sources. We connect them into something coherent. We maintain it over time.

You get a foundation, not a data project.

The result: decision-ready building information, accessible to anyone.

---

## Who It's For

Anyone who needs building data and doesn't want to start from scratch.

---

## Roadmap

Start where we are: Switzerland. The basics are there. Now we add insights.

Topics will follow demand – carbon, market data, location. We stay small until we know what's actually useful.

The problem isn't Swiss. We'll expand when the foundation is solid.

---

## Business Model

Free: Explore, search, download individual buildings. The foundation is open.

Paid: Bulk data, API access, portfolio reports. For organizations that need more and can afford to contribute.

Revenue keeps the foundation maintained. The core stays open.

---

## Principles

Open by default. If we figured it out, you don't have to. Methods, sources, flaws and limitations – all public.

Quality over quantity. Good data beats more data. Focus, don't get lost.

Interoperable and stable. Technology changes every few years. Buildings last centuries. We follow national and international standards so the architecture outlives the tools.

---

## Success Metrics (12 months)

Does it work? Are people using it? Is it sustainable?

That's it. Numbers follow.

---

## Get Involved
