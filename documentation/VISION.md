# Product Vision

## Make Public Building Data Truly Public

Governments collect it. We make it usable. Free, open, for everyone.

---

## The Problem

Every country collects building data — registries, cadastres, permits, energy certificates. It's "open" in theory. In practice? Fragmented across agencies, buried in technical formats, requiring specialized tools.

The people who need it most — property owners, planners, citizens — can't access it.

**Building data is technically public but practically locked.** This creates an invisible divide: those with GIS skills can access it, everyone else cannot.

---

## The Opportunity

What if we did the heavy lifting?

Aggregated the sources. Normalized the formats. Calculated the metrics. And gave it away.

A global commons for building data, starting with one country that does it exceptionally well: Switzerland.

---

## The Vision

> **Building data belongs to everyone — but today, only specialists can access it. We bridge that gap. One open platform that transforms scattered public registers into clear, decision-ready information. Starting with Switzerland. Built for the world.**

A world where anyone can understand any building — its size, its age, its energy profile, its context — without needing to be a data scientist.

Open infrastructure for data-driven decisions.

## Guiding Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Less data, more insight** | We curate what matters. Not everything — just what drives decisions. |
| **Accessible by default** | If you need GIS skills to use it, we failed. |
| **Neutral & interoperable** | No vendor lock-in, no proprietary formats, no regional silos. |
| **Open core** | Free to view, free to use, documentation public. Premium for power users. |
| **Global vision, local start** | Switzerland first, but architected for anywhere. |

---

## Positioning

This isn't a startup. It's **public infrastructure with a sustainability model**.

| Layer | Access | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Data** | Free | Browse any building, see key metrics, explore the map |
| **Platform** | Open Source | Self-host, contribute, extend |
| **Documentation** | Public | Methodology, data sources, limitations — full transparency |
| **Premium** | Paid | Detailed reports, bulk exports, API access, white-label |

The premium layer funds the mission. The core remains free forever.

## Why Switzerland First?

Switzerland offers world-class open geodata infrastructure:

- **GWR** — National building and dwelling register
- **Amtliche Vermessung** — Authoritative cadastral survey
- **swissALTI3D / swissSURFACE3D** — High-precision elevation models
- **geo.admin.ch** — Unified API access to federal spatial data

It's the perfect proving ground. But the problem we're solving exists everywhere.

## What We Believe

- Information wants to be free
- Public data should be publicly usable
- Complexity is a barrier to participation
- Data-driven decisions shouldn't require a data science degree
- Open infrastructure benefits everyone

## Summary

```
THE PROBLEM
Public building data exists but isn't truly accessible.
Only specialists can use it. This limits informed decisions.

THE SOLUTION  
We aggregate, normalize, and visualize public building data.
Free to use. Open source. No GIS skills required.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Connect to authoritative public sources
2. Calculate meaningful metrics (volume, area, energy)
3. Present it simply — search, map, understand

STARTING POINT
Switzerland — world-class open geodata, perfect proving ground.

BUSINESS MODEL
Core platform: Free forever
Premium features: Detailed reports, API, bulk access
Sustainability without gatekeeping.

VISION
Building data belongs to everyone.
We're making that real — one country at a time.
```
