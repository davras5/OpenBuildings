# Product Vision

## Make Public Building Data Truly Public

Governments collect it. We make it usable. Free, open, for everyone.

---

## From Need to Know to Right to Know

Public building data has always operated on a "need to know" basis. Technically open, but practically restricted to those with the skills, tools, and time to extract it.

We believe in a different principle: **the right to know.**

If governments collect data about our buildings — with public resources, for public purposes — then everyone should be able to access and understand it. Not just specialists. Not just those who can afford consultants. Everyone.

---

## The Problem

Every country collects building data — registries, cadastres, permits, energy certificates. It's "open" in theory. In practice? Fragmented across agencies, buried in technical formats, requiring specialized tools.

The people who need it most — property owners, planners, municipalities, citizens — can't access it.

**Building data is technically public but practically locked.** This creates an invisible divide: those with GIS skills can access it, everyone else cannot.

---

## Why This Matters Now

Buildings account for roughly **40% of global CO₂ emissions**. Every credible path to carbon neutrality by 2050 requires decarbonizing the building stock.

But here's the problem:

> **You can't decarbonize what you can't measure.**

To plan retrofits, prioritize investments, or track progress toward net zero, you need answers:

- What buildings exist? How big are they?
- How old are they? What condition?
- What's the energy source? Heating system?
- Where are the biggest opportunities?

This data exists. It's collected by governments everywhere. But it's scattered across spreadsheets, siloed in departments, or simply inaccessible.

**The result: climate strategies based on incomplete data — or no data at all.**

| Who | The Reality |
|-----|-------------|
| Small municipalities | No GIS staff, no budget, data in paper archives or Excel |
| Institutional investors | Portfolios spread across regions, inconsistent data, can't benchmark |
| Public agencies | Data exists but siloed, no unified view of the building stock |
| Building owners | Want to act but don't know where to start — no baseline |

We can't meet our climate targets with spreadsheets and guesswork.

---

## The Opportunity

What if we did the heavy lifting?

Aggregated the sources. Normalized the formats. Calculated the metrics. And gave it away.

A global commons for building data — the baseline layer for both transparency and climate action.

Starting with one country that does it exceptionally well: Switzerland.

---

## The Vision

> **Building data belongs to everyone — but today, only specialists can access it. We bridge that gap. One open platform that transforms scattered public registers into clear, decision-ready information. Starting with Switzerland. Built for the world.**

A world where anyone can understand any building — its size, its age, its energy profile, its context — without needing to be a data scientist.

**Open infrastructure for data-driven decisions. And for the climate transition we all depend on.**

---

## Two Pillars

### 1. Open Data as a Right

Public data should be publicly usable. Not locked behind technical barriers. Not restricted to specialists. Accessible to everyone, by default.

### 2. Open Data as Climate Action

Decarbonizing buildings requires knowing what we have. Quality data isn't a luxury — it's the foundation. Without it, net zero remains a target without a map.

---

## Guiding Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Right to know** | Public data belongs to the public. We make that real. |
| **Less data, more insight** | We curate what matters. Not everything — just what drives decisions. |
| **Accessible by default** | If you need GIS skills to use it, we failed. |
| **Neutral & interoperable** | No vendor lock-in, no proprietary formats, no regional silos. |
| **Open core** | Free to view, free to use, documentation public. Premium for power users. |
| **Global vision, local start** | Switzerland first, but architected for anywhere. |

---

## Positioning

This isn't a startup. It's **public infrastructure with a sustainability model**.

| Layer | Access | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Data** | Free | Browse any building, see key metrics, explore the map |
| **Platform** | Open Source | Self-host, contribute, extend |
| **Documentation** | Public | Methodology, data sources, limitations — full transparency |
| **Premium** | Paid | Detailed reports, bulk exports, API access, white-label |

The premium layer funds the mission. The core remains free forever.

---

## Why Switzerland First?

Switzerland offers world-class open geodata infrastructure:

- **GWR** — National building and dwelling register
- **Amtliche Vermessung** — Authoritative cadastral survey
- **swissALTI3D / swissSURFACE3D** — High-precision elevation models
- **geo.admin.ch** — Unified API access to federal spatial data

It's the perfect proving ground. But the problem we're solving — and the climate challenge we're addressing — exists everywhere.

---

## What We Believe

- Information wants to be free
- Public data is a right, not a privilege
- Complexity is a barrier to participation
- Data-driven decisions shouldn't require a data science degree
- Climate action requires quality data — for everyone, not just those who can afford it
- Open infrastructure benefits everyone

## Summary

```
THE PROBLEM
Public building data exists but isn't truly accessible.
Only specialists can use it. This limits informed decisions —
and undermines our ability to meet climate targets.

THE SOLUTION  
We aggregate, normalize, and visualize public building data.
Free to use. Open source. No GIS skills required.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Connect to authoritative public sources
2. Calculate meaningful metrics (volume, area, energy)
3. Present it simply — search, map, understand

WHY IT MATTERS
Buildings = 40% of global emissions.
You can't decarbonize what you can't measure.
Quality data shouldn't be a luxury.

STARTING POINT
Switzerland — world-class open geodata, perfect proving ground.

BUSINESS MODEL
Core platform: Free forever
Premium features: Detailed reports, API, bulk access
Sustainability without gatekeeping.

VISION
Building data belongs to everyone.
From need to know — to right to know.
We're making that real, one country at a time.
```
