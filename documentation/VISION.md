**Swiss building data. Open by default. Open in practice.**

---

## Mission

To provide a **shared, authoritative foundation for Swiss building data**—open, connected, and maintained—so public institutions and large organizations can plan, report, and act with confidence.

---

## What It Is

OpenBuildings is a **national-scale data foundation for buildings**.

We curate, harmonize, and maintain Switzerland’s most important open building datasets into a single, coherent reference layer—ready for use in planning, reporting, policy design, and portfolio management.

This is not a one-off data project.  
It is **infrastructure**.

---

## The Problem

Data-driven decision-making is widely expected—and rarely supported.

- Smaller organizations lack the resources to build and maintain reliable building data.
- Larger institutions do build it—but internally, repeatedly, and temporarily.
- Results remain siloed, undocumented, and eventually obsolete.

The same work is redone across municipalities, cantons, agencies, utilities, and portfolios—often with public money—without a shared baseline.

The workflow is the same whether you manage **300 buildings or 3 million**.  
Yet everyone stops at their own boundary.

This leads to fragmentation, inefficiency, and inconsistent results.

## Why It Matters

Buildings account for **~40% of Switzerland’s CO₂ emissions**.  
Every credible climate, energy, housing, or infrastructure strategy depends on understanding the building stock.

You cannot:
- decarbonize what you cannot measure,
- coordinate what you cannot compare,
- or govern what you cannot reproduce.

Today, many organizations are either estimating blindly or paying repeatedly for what should already exist.

A shared foundation changes this:
- Consistent metrics across communes, cantons, and portfolios
- Comparable reporting over time
- Lower costs through reuse
- Better decisions with less friction

One foundation. Many applications. Public value multiplied.

---

## How It Works

- We identify the **most relevant public data sources** (e.g. GWR, cadastral survey, elevation models, zoning data).
- We harmonize schemas, resolve identifiers, and document assumptions.
- We maintain the dataset as sources evolve.

You receive a **stable reference layer**, not a bespoke study.

---

## Who It’s For

- Municipalities and cantons developing climate, energy, or housing strategies
- Federal agencies and public institutions requiring consistent reporting
- Large portfolio owners and operators
- Researchers and analysts who want to focus on insight, not data wrangling

If building data is essential—but not your core mandate—this is for you.

---

## Roadmap

Switzerland first.

The foundation exists. Next comes depth:
- Carbon and energy indicators
- Market and location analytics
- Policy-relevant aggregations

We expand only where there is demonstrated demand and institutional value.

The challenge is not uniquely Swiss—but credibility comes from doing one country well.

---

## Sustainability Model

**Open access**  
Search, explore, and download individual buildings. The foundation remains open.

**Cost recovery for institutions**  
Bulk access, APIs, portfolio analyses, and operational integrations.

Revenue funds maintenance and continuity—so the data remains reliable over time.

---

## Principles

**Open by default**  
Methods, sources, and limitations are documented and public.

**Institutional quality**  
Reproducibility, traceability, and long-term maintainability matter more than novelty.

**Interoperability**  
Buildings last centuries. Software does not.  
We align with established standards so the data outlives the tools.

---

## Get Involved

Use it. Challenge it. Improve it.

A shared foundation only works if it is actually shared.

OpenBuildings turns that principle into infrastructure.*
